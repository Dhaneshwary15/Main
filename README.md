CRUD API with TypeScript

This project demonstrates a simple CRUD (Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete) API built with TypeScript and Express. It allows you to manage a "User" resource through basic CRUD operations. The API is designed to follow best practices for building a scalable and maintainable backend.

Key Features:
Create a new user
Retrieve user data (fetch a single user or all users)
Update existing user details
Delete a user by their ID
Input Validation: Uses the Zod library to validate incoming request data
In-memory data storage: Data is stored in memory, so there's no need for an external database
Standardized API responses: All responses are structured consistently for better error handling and clarity

Testing:
You can use Postman to test the API endpoints, such as creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting users. Postman helps in sending HTTP requests and reviewing responses to ensure the API works as expected.
